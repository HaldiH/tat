# Welcome to TAT

This website is the documentation for the TAT GUI. For users, you can see guides inside the _User guide_ section. A section for developpers will be added in the future.

## Getting started

If you are a user, you can follow the [installation guide](user-guide/installation.md) and the [user guide](user-guide/usage.md).

### Fast introduction

TAT needs Python >= 3.8.

TAT is available in PyPI, thus you can install it with `pip`:

```shell
pip install tat
```

And then you can run the application as a Python module:

```shell
python -m tat
```
